# The ABCs of Variable Annuities

Non-insurance sponsored reviews of annuities tend to be overwhelmingly negative. Internet opinion is that these are tools you should not be using. Presenter doesn't believe so, but believes it is a misinterpretation. 

In his mind, they are just a tool among other tools. He believes that opinion is this way because they are incredible confusing, and can be very expensive. Should not tie all your money up in annuities. 

Variable annuities are the only tool in the world that can give you a **guaranteed** income stream. They are expensive and not liquid, but you have to understand the trade-offs and not overutilize them. 

## What is a variable annuity?

> If you are buying a variable annuity to fund a 
retirement plan that already provides tax deferral 
under sections of the Internal Revenue
code (such as IRA, QP, 401(k) and TSA), you 
should do so for the variable annuity’s features 
and benefits other than tax deferral. 
In such situations, tax deferral is not an 
additional benefit. References throughout this 
presentation to tax treatment, such as tax 
deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this 
consideration. 
You may also want to consider the relative 
features, benefits, and costs of this annuity with 
any other investment that you may have in 
connection with your retirement plan or 
arrangement. Moreover, withdrawals of taxable 
portions are taxed at ordinary income tax rates 
and withdrawals taken prior to age 591/2 may be 
subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. 
Guarantees are based on the claims-paying 
ability of the issuing insurance company.

Annuities are long-term financial products 
designed for retirement purposes. In 
essence, annuities are contractual 
agreements in which payment(s) are made to 
an insurance company, which agrees to pay 
out an income or lump sum amount at a later 
date. There are contract limitations and fees 
and charges associated with annuities, which 
include, but are not limited to, mortality and 
expense risk charges, sales and surrender 
charges, administrative fees, and charges for 
optional benefits. A financial professional can 
provide cost information and complete 
details.

Look out for those insurance companies and their issuing quality. If they are promising 5% then make sure they are likely to pay. 

## How does a variable annuity work?

### The Distribution (pay-out) phase

> Initial Payment -> Variable Annuity Contract -> Variable Investment Options

There are two basic types of annuities - immediate and deferred. We are primarily talking about deferred. 

**Immediate annuities** - you give a principal sum to an insurance company, you forfeit the privilege to those dollars and it is no longer yours. You cannot get your money back. In return, the insurance company makes payments to you ask long as you live, no matter what. 

Deferred annuities are more flexible.

Each can be fixed or variable. Fixed rate of return for a fixed period of time. Variable can go up or down depending on how the investments perform.

Most variable annuities have some performance guarantee associated with them. 

They are expensive because of these guarantees of payouts for the rest of your life. 

### The Accumulation (pay-out) phase

> Variable Annuity Contract -> Annuity Income -> Payment Receiving Options


## The benefits of tax deferral

> This hypothetical example is for illustrative 
purposes only. The assumed 8% return is not 
guaranteed and is not intended to reflect the actual 
performance of any product or any other 
investment. Neither example reflects deductions for 
any fees or expenses which would reduce the 
investment performance shown. Variable annuities 
generally impose withdrawal charges based on a 
particular product’s surrender charge schedule. 
Annual administration and mortality and expense 
risk charges generally apply to assets in the 
investment options. Investment management 
fees vary by investment subaccount. Tax rates and 
tax treatment of earnings may impact comparative 
results. Lower maximum tax 
rates on capital gains and dividends would make 
the return of the taxable investment more favorable, 
thereby reducing the difference 
in performance between the accounts shown. State 
and local taxes should also be considered. 
Withdrawals made prior to age 591/2
may result in an additional 10% federal tax penalty.
Please consider your personal investment horizon 
and income tax bracket, both current and 
anticipated, when making an investment decision as 
these may further impact the results of the 
comparison.
