# Financial Strategies 101

## Advantages of Smart Financial Management

### Financial Management

* Starts with your first paycheck
* A financial program is simply a map for the future that can help you achieve your financial dreams
* Advantages of financial management
	* Keeps you focused
	* A track to run on, and a game plan
	* Coordination of all your goals
	* Organization

The presence of a plan will get you a lot further along than if you don't. Allows you to take an accurate inventory of your assets. This will bring tangible and immediately results. 

## Overcoming Obstacles to Success

* Expectations -- but no goals
* "Kiss of Debt"
* Inflation
* Procrastination

### "Kiss Of Debt"

> Some debts are fun when you are acquiring them, but non are fun when you set about retiring them. - Ogden Nash

* "Painless plastic"
* Do the math
	* For a credit card balance of $3,000 at 12% interest rate...
		* If you pay a $50 monthly payment
			* It will take 92 payments (7.7 years) to pay off
			* Interest alone is $1,558

Using non-collateralized consumer debt is almost always a bad idea. Example: replacing all 4 tires at once, feels "unexpected". But in reality, if you have a budget plan, this should be anticipated. We tend to over-utilize consumer debt.

### Steps to decrease consumer debt

* STOP CHARGING!
* Focus on those cards with the highest annual rate and pay those off first
* Commit to paying MORE than the minimum each month
* Transfer balances to lower cost cards or obtain a home equity loan
	* it will lower your interest and make payment more manageable. But often in short order they will jack up the credit card debt. It is a symptom of a problem, not a solution.
* Establish a realistic budget -- and stick to it!

### Inflation

Erosion of buying power.

$1 in 1913 Had the Same Buying Power as:

* $ 2.43 in 1950
* $ 3.92 in 1970
* $ 13.20 in 1990
* $20.94 in 2007
* **$23.62 in 2013! **

It takes about 24 years for the cost of goods and services to double. 

You can't just put your money in the mattress. You might have experience with extreme market volatility, but if you're not earning interest you are losing.

### The Cost of Procrastination

You will always have competing demands, so stop putting it off!

### How to get started

* Budget/Cash management
	* Use something/anything to track your expenses, it doesn't matter what tool. 
* Insurance
* Estate plan
* Investments
* Taxes
* Retirement plan

### Setting goals and making fixes

## Financial Management Components

### Cash management

### Risk management

* Cornerstone of a sound financial program
	* Property and casualty & liability protection
	* Health insurance
	* Life, disability income and long-term care insurance

Regularly review whether these plans are appropriate for your current situation

Protect your single most valuable asset (your ability to generate an annual income)

* Life insurance
	* Your ability to generate income is the foundation of your family's financial independence
* Disability income insurance
	* 1 out of every 7 workers will suffer a five-year or longer period of disability before age 65
* Long-term care insurance
	* 70% of people over age 65 will need long-term care in their lifetimes
	* Over 40% will need care in a nursing home for some period of time

Thomson Reuters offers all of these. 

### Estate planning strategies 

Your estate is everything you own:

* Realty: Home, land, buildings
* Personal: Jewelry, furniture, etc
* Financial: IRAs, investments, pension and insurance

A plan addresses who, when and how these assets are distributed -- this puts the power in YOUR hands. 

#### You need a will

**If there are people and/or assets you care about, YOU NEED A WILL!**

What your will can do:

* Name heirs and when they get your property
* Designate guardians of minor children
* Establish trusts to protect property
* Reduce expenses (waive fees)
* Provide bequests to charities
* Reduce estate taxes (through trusts)


### Investment strategies

* Help build greater long-term financial independence
* Establish goals 
* Develop a program to meet them

You are essentially deferring enjoyment of the money you are earning for your long-term enjoyment in the future. 

#### Getting started

* Getting started can be tough
* Common reasons to postpone:
	* "The amount I have to invest is too small to make a difference..."
	* "I've got a baby on the way and there are other needs..."
	* "I've got two kids nearing college and can't afford it..."
	* "We're Empty Nesters and we want to travel..."
	* "...I've run out of time."

#### Efficient frontier

They find that people can almost always reduce their risk with the same rate of return, or increase their return with the same amount of risk.

### Tax-reduction strategies

#### Risk/reward pyramid

You want to diversify among all of these.

The power of tax deferral is huge! The growth rate of your account is stifled due to less compounding, so defer all you can!

Municipal bonds are tax exempt at the federal level. 

### Retirement programs

#### Why is your employer's 401k so important?

* A fast way to save for retirement that also provides tax benefits and employer matches
* Funding plans correctly can:
	* Reduce the money needed to save for retirement
	* May substantially increase a tax refund due to refundable credits like the additional child tax credit and earned income tax credit
* Two types of contribution types 401k and 403b: Roth and traditional
	* Modified adjusted gross income thresholds and impact IRA contributions do not affect these plans

#### Consider a Roth IRA

* If you qualify for a Roth IRA
	* Consider funding it!
	* But if you already have a 401k
		* Consider funding 401k to emplower match
		* Then, fund Roth IRA (assuming you meet income requirements)
		* Then, resume funding 401k
* If you don't qualify for a Roth IRA...
	* Consider reducing taxable income using other techniques

## FAQ

* Stock market has a ton of volatility, how to prepare for this?
	* Every investment advisor today is expecting a market correction on equity prices. Price to earnings ratio has reached unsustainable levels. He is inclined to believe this, so he is not adding new dollars to equity exposures until the correction occurs. Does not believe it will be cataclysmic.
* Long-term care insurance is hard to decipher, can you explain?
	* It is a very malleable insurance product. You can customize it to almost any set of circumstances, which makes it confusing. Think of it as asset insurance. Don't buy any more coverage than what you have in assets
* How do you know how much to save if you are not sure what you want to do in your retirement years?
	* The first job of a competent retirement plan would be to live the same lifestyle you are accustomed to. At a minimum it should cover this case. Often people want to enhance their lifestyle to enjoy retirement. 
* Do not attempt to benchmark your portfolio against indexes like the S&P 500. Instead, we should be determining based on where we are and where we are going to be, how much do we have to return in order to keep living our lifestyles. 
* He is not a big fan of pre-paying student loans. They cannot take the degree away from you and you cannot get that money back. As long as the loans are relatively low interest.
