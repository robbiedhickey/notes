# Platform Focus Series - Elasticsearch, Hadoop & Analytics

Want to highlight elasticsearch as a platform capability, then outline how we are using Hadoop for analytics.

## Elasticsearch

### What is it?

A new open source search technology: elasticsearch.org -- built on top of Lucene

* Strengths in
	* real-time indexing
	* Searching fielded document structures
	* Lower costs when
		* requiring simpler search requirements
		* Installed as smaller isolated instances
	* Plug & play architecture
		* can leverage custom components

It is fairly lightweight and easy to get started.

### Goals as a Platform

* Provide a fully operationalized elasticsearch based search service
* Provide expertise, solution support and easy accessibility to capabilities to platform customers
* Apply the learning from our experience in building and running a distributed Search & Retrieval platform
* Provide two complementary Search capabilities (Novus & elasticsearch) to platform customers
	* Novus & elasticsearch are very similar in architecture, differently implemented; different strengths

### What does it provide as a platform?

* Faster time to market (production ready hosting models)
* Expertise and support
* Deployment and service management tools
* Plug-ins, software add-ons & development tools
* Operationalized for production (versions, scale, configurations)
* Leverage: User & Developer communities
