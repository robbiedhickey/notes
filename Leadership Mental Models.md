## Credibility

* This is the core of all the other mental models, without it none of the others matter. 
* You monetize credibility as influence within an organization. 
* Your personal 'stock price'. Each interaction is a chance to build or lose credibility. 
* It is half of what you say and do, and half what your team members say and do.
	* if you tolerate bad behavior, you inherit it. 

### Building Credibility

* Do your job
* Be prepared and professional
* Get on 'their side of the table' 
	* Especially important for technology folks. Understand the problem in their terms and communicate in their terms
* Avoid technical jargon
	* can box you into a stereotype
	* it makes the other person feel inferior, not conducive to collaboration
* Admit mistakes early and avoid excuses
	* When someone admits mistakes, it builds trust
* Deal with problem performers quickly
	* eventually this will be seen as a reflection on you and your team
	* What if you don't like confrontation?
		* think about it in the sense that they are detracting from the rest of the team's efforts. May be uncomfortable but if you don't you are cheating your entire team and yourself.
	* You are the PR manager for your team. 
	* Tell people there are problems, be transparent about your expectations.

## Filters Matter

This essentially boils down to personal awareness. Filters = Perceptions.

### Negative Role-Specific Filters

Ex. selling features we haven't built, focusing on new technology instead of what customer needs

### Negative Personal Filters

Ex. lack of urgency, cynical/pessimistic.

### How do you identify your negative perceptions?

* Find an honest feedback source (hopefully your boss)
	* if not your boss, find another source. Possibly identify people who report to you and ask questions about the messages you put out.
	* peers can also be a great source of honest feedback
	* also ask your spouse, probably a great source!
* Self-reflection is key
* Work to avoid your negative filters
* Communicate differently
	* cater to your audience
	* they will understand that you have thought about their problems and appreciate that
	* attempt to specifically avoid your known negative filters
* Acknowledge known filters and use them tactically
	* address the fact that you are using them so that you are not stereotyped.
