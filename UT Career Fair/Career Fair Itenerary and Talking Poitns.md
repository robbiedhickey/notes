### Talking Points

* Moving toward SOA across the company. 
* Will be talking to a mix of students - juniors through seniors
* We have an interest in the compsci divison. 
* What do you guys do? need a 15-20 second elevator pitch that conveys highlights of what T&R is and what the tax and accounting division does
	* $13B provider of information software and services. 60,000 employees in 105 countries. Headquartered in Carrollton. Service Fortune 500/1000 companies and large government organizations. 3rd largest software provider in DFW. Convey that we are a technology company and the implications of that. 
	* Focus on T&A, for now it is an internal initiative and keep the scope. Quickly transition into what their major is, when they graduate, what they're interested in -- see if there is a fit. 
	* Career sheets will be available at the fair with the spots we are focusing on - become familiar with them
		* We will focus on internship program - entry level software engineer and quality assurance program. Also information for the architecture roles.
		* Aaron longoria can handle the internship program
		* Monica can handle all HR related questions
		* The theme is stick to what you know and let subject matter experts handle questions in their wheelhouse 
	* We need to get the details of the internship program - sponsorship, etc
* Branding opportunity - make sure they know how to pronounce the name
* We will have literature and branding to hand out as well. 
* We definitely want to collect resumes. Remember those that you connect with and put those to the side as someone we want to connect with. 
* How can we followup with them? Ideas?
